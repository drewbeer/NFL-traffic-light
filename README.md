# NFL-traffic-light
A old traffic light to blink based on whats happening during NFL games.

the reason its split is because i use the light for other home automation tasks, all documented here...

[Traffic light NFL project](https://drew.beer/blog/blog/nfl-traffic-light)

#### web server

```
./gpio-web.pl daemon
```

### nfl.pl
```
./nfl.pl
```

may throw some errors because some vars don't exist for comparing, eventually i'll clean that up
